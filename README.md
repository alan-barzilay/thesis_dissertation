# Master thesis dissertation


This repository keeps all (.tex and other) files used to create the final version of my thesis. It was mostly developed on overleaf but by the end of it the compilation was timing out in the free plan so I started working locally, so this repo doesn' t really reflect its development process.

This repository also contains some of the feedback I received as well as the final compiled version for convenience sake (compiled and uploaded manually since setting a pipeline to detect changes and recompile seemed like overkill for the moment).

This thesis may also be seen at the [university theses bank](https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-18012024-163530/en.php).
