A recent survey reported that reviewers consider conformance to the project's code style to be one of the top priorities when evaluating code contributions on Github. We propose to quantitatively evaluate the existence and effects of this phenomenon. To this aim we use language models, which were shown to accurately capture stylistic aspects of code. We find that rejected change sets do contain code significantly less similar to the project than accepted ones, furthermore, the less similar change sets are more likely to be subject to thorough review. Armed with these results we further investigate whether new contributors learn to conform to the project style and find that experience is positively correlated with conformance to the project's code style.},
